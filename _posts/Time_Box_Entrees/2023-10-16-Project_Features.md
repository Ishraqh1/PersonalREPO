## Project Feautes
> Frontend
- Various screens and menus have been made, such as boss fight screen and character creation screen
- Images have been implemented
- Styling has been completed

> Backend
- First show him original API. We worked on this together and this is what my issue is about. My specific contributions were the modules, imports, and get functionality. However, we realized that the API may not be able to function as we intended it to function, especially since getting each individual value one by one might not be effective or proper for our usage (since we also want to update information as well), so we searched and found SQAlchemy. We worked together on the new API and managed to get the REST API functions to work.

> DevOPS
- Backend has been deployed on AWS, duckDNS
- Been tested, and API modified to make it run properly
