-   Exemplar in Team work. Fosters community of learning beyond individual or single friend.
    -   As a team in CSP we maintained steady communication through githuh. We scheduled times were we discussed work loads over discord and used steady communication to ensure success.
    -   As a team in the begining of CPT project, we worked together to figure out forks in GitHub in order to avoid more merge conflicts. We spent time experimenting with various forks, pull requests, syncs, and more.
    -   Here are the forks we made of the frontend and backend: <img src="../../../images/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 1.49.23 PM.png"> <img src="../../../images/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 1.50.58 PM.png">

-   AP preparation progress
    -   To prepare for the AP college board quiz I took notes on many of the subjects that were important to understand the material better: [Doc Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uGNQVEkKN8KeTsF5ttWY5Y0XxeLtTINizG3fOql8t0g/edit?usp=sharing)
-   Key commits
    -   Started working on frontend and got the main display working: <img src="../../../images/Screenshot 2024-03-01 at 8.58.33 AM.png"> <img src="../../../images/Screenshot 2024-03-01 at 8.58.33 AM.png">

> GitHub Pages Blog. Student makes quality effort to record histories and solicit utterances/issue comments on AP and Project work.

-   I used utterances and comments throughout the trimester. Utterance's were made on this post when I did a peer review for the final: [Utterance I've left](https://github.com/KaramKambo/stunew/issues/1)
-   My Individual final: [CSP Trimester 2 Individual Final](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/student/issues/126)

> AP work. All AP work is understood, reviewed, and is determined by Teacher to be your own work. Student should be proactive in demonstrating understanding of CPT requirements and AP quiz elements.

-   Preparation for AP exam requirements in blog post "Individual Final", all AP requirements met and code snippets prepared.
    -   Video and video requirements are also there.

> Project work. Student follows team requirements and expectations. They are active in the Scrum work and timelines. They produce code early enough to all Pull request integrations and testing, e.g. two days in advance of Teacher review.
