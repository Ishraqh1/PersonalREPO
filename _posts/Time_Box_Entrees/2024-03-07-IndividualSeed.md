-   Exceptional achievement. 93% or better in last trimester of CompSci.
    -   Grade in Trimester 2 is above 93%: <img src="../../../images/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 1.31.58 PM.png">
-   Exemplar in Team work. Fosters community of learning beyond individual or single friend.
    -   As a team in CSP we maintained steady communication through githuh. We scheduled times were we discussed work loads over discord and used steady communication to ensure success.
    -   As a team in the begining of CPT project, we worked together to figure out forks in GitHub in order to avoid more merge conflicts. We spent time experimenting with various forks, pull requests, syncs, and more.
    -   Here are the forks we made of the frontend and backend: <img src="../../../images/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 1.49.23 PM.png"> <img src="../../../images/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 1.50.58 PM.png">

-   AP preparation progress
    -   To prepare for the AP college board quiz I took notes on many of the subjects that were important to understand the material better: [Doc Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uGNQVEkKN8KeTsF5ttWY5Y0XxeLtTINizG3fOql8t0g/edit?usp=sharing)
-   Key commits
