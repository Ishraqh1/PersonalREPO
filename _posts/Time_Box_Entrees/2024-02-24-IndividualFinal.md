## Personalized Project Reference
> Procedure: Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a student-developed procedure that implements an algorithm used in your program and a call to that procedure.
- i. The first-program code segment must be a student-developed procedure that:
    - Defines the procedure's name and return type (if necessary)
    - Contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect on the functionality of the procedure
    - Implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection and iteration
- ii. The second program code segment must show where your student-developed procedure is being called in your program.

> List:	Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a list (or other collection type) being used to manage complexity in your program.
- i. The first program code segment must show how data have been stored in the list.
- ii. The second program code segment must show the data in the same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling the program's purpose.

## Written Response 1: Program, Design, Function, and Purpose
> CRD-2.A: Describe the purpose of a computing innovation.  
- The purpose of my program is to provide entertainment to the user while also strengthening their logical thinking and reasoning by having them predict where the AI could be in order to maximize their probability of winning.

> CRD-2.B: Explain how a program or code segment functions.  
- 

> CRD-2.C: Identify input(s) to a program. 

> CRD-2.D: Identify output(s) produced by a program. 

> CRD-2.E: Develop a program using a development process. 

> CRD-2.F: Design a program and its user interface. 

> CRD-2.G: Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation.
