## Thursday:
> Routing and Computer Student Lesson
- Some notes I took during lesson, as they didn't give us the .ipynb or .md beforehand:
= network is connecting devices together so data can be shared
- fault tolerance = tolerate fault; if theres a break in a path, another path is still available + important bc if one route slow, then other routes are available
- fault = connection lost (line broke) between computers
- redundancy = multiple paths to the same place, so even if one breaks, things can still be sent to it
- fast network = fast/short route, no need to go from a to b to c to ..., just go a to z
- parallel vs distributed computing: parallel has smultiple cores for 1 task, all do same thing vs. distributed has multiple computers for 1 task + network / routing like, send stuff to other things to do
- sequential computing
