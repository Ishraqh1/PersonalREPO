## Review Ticket (This is a guideline of what to show, present everything in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode)
> HTML
- Present in Jupyter Notebook
- Fulfilled the requirement of the wireframe with two divs, a heading, top paragraph, a button, two links, and a bottom paragraph
- Added my own styling
- Added passion and project idea of trying to make Dark Souls in terminal

> Data Types
- Present in Jupyter Notebook, show console
- Added few extra variables (birthdate, age of team members)
- Showed multiple outputs and logged to console the actions taken, which were: adding to array, removing from array, changing array values, doing math with numbers in array, and logging everything at the end

> DOM
- Present in VSCode
- Built off of HTML and added a little more styling for fun
- Created the switch button and it works in VSCode

> JS
- Present in Jupyter Notebook, show console
- Completed requirement of comparing two variables and outputting different message depending on the relative values using conditional statements
- Added value and meaning to variables to align with potential project idea

> Debugging
- Completed requirements of fixing all 3 code segments and listing the changes made to fix the code
- Also completed the extra one and attempted the challenge. I tried to make it work but didn't get anywhere so I just learned what I could and moved on
