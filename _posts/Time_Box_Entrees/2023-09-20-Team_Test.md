## How we made the Team Test
If you would like to see the day by day procedure, please look at the daily plan! We first established a Scrum Master to facilitate the work, created a manifesto to establish a few ground rules, and made a group chat. We then split up the work among ourselves by giving each person a section to focus on, but everyone would aid each other if needed. After repeated coding and editing, we polished up the programs and Google Slides with the manifesto, collaboration, and Agile diagram. At the end, we presented to Mr. Mortenson and got a 4/4!
