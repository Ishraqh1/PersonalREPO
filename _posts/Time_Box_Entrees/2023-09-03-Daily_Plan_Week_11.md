## Monday:
> Work on API and data model, update with Matthew's CORS and remove inventory (implement and fix later)

> Update frontend repository

> Test GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and all works so qualify tomorrow

## Tuesday:
> Did Qualification Test / Final Project - Team, we qualified :DDD. While we did qualify, there are a few refinements that need to be made and we should plan our presentation better to showcase our requests and have the leaderboard update live on another computer.

## Wednesday:
> No school

## Thursday:
> Dress rehearsal for Night at the Museum, [here are the comments we recieved from other groups!](https://github.com/M8tth3/ramjiJarmi/issues/7)
- First half we presented to the grading half of the class
- Second half we swapped roles and graded the other half of the class

> Review N@TM plan and practice for presenting

> Look over Individual Final

## Friday:
> Completed Individual Final, talked for like 20-30 minutes by accident but it worked out in the end and I got 9.6/10 which I am very happy about
- Next trimester try to branch out a bit more and maybe dive into more Javascript by trying out frontend instead of backend
- Ask more questions and get more feedback
