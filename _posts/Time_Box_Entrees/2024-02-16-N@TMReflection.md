## Blog / article on you and team
> Reflection on glows/grows from your demo
- Glows: I feel at least from user feedback that during our demo at night at the museum we worked very well together as a team and our code worked phenomenally with no demos running into unexpected bugs or issues.
- Grows: I feel what we really need to work on going forward is finishing certain mechanics within our project in order to be more user friendly as well as refining certain styling portions of our page in order to really make it feel complete.

> From feedback, something you will add to individual CPT project
- After N@TM, we realized that when played by a large number of people it's hard to differentiate users and their chosen characters, so we plan to integrate the characters you make into your saved User Login stats. We also heard from people that sometimes the alerts were annoying to manage as we alerted the user both when the enemy missed and when they missed. We plan to make that more streamlined. I also saw that in other projects their was better usage of CSS for website backgrounds, and we thought that it would be cool to make our page more fantasy themed overall. In our own individual CPT projects, we plan to integrate things like our current user (current character) system so you can access personal info securely.

> Something you saw in CompSci that impressed
- A project I saw in CompSci that was impressive was a program similar to Naviance to aid college searches. It featured a massive database of tons of colleges and had various functionalities such as being able to search for a college, picking one to save into a list, taking a quiz to see what colleges fit your interestins, and more! The team was very knowledgeable about the code and guided me through both how the frontend sends requests and formats the data and how the backend handles such requests.

> Something you saw outside of CompSci that you liked
- Our team checked out the art room and saw many diverse drawings and paintings.  There was a bunch of different styles which impressed us. Their was a range of portraits, posters, and landscapes which were detailed and all unique. Overall, we thought that our schools artistic ability was very impressive.
