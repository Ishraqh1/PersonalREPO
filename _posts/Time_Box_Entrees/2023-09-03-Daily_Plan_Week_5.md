- My paragraph: I found this alumni panel to be very eye-opening and guiding! Every single alumni had their own unique path in life, experiences in and after high school, and opinions on what to do as a high school student and what to focus on. I found Tristan's path to be the most interesting as rather than going into college and studying Computer Science or a similar major, he landed a job at LG by going out of his way to make various projects during the school year and learning how to use a vast array of tools. I have never heard of anyone doing this before, and listening to him explain his story and his choices in high school opened a new path towards the future for me. Personally, I will still be striving for college after high school, but will definitely check out the tools he recommended and try to work on a few personal projects in my spare time. I found Colin's and Mabel's advice to internships to be very helpful as well. They recommended to check out various professors and their projects or websites, pick a project, and try to purposefully redesign it so it's more efficient. I had never thought about doing something like that and I find it to be a clever way to both pursue your passion and give you an edge above other applicants. I will definitely be trying this in the future! Lastly, Anthony's advice about starting Leetcode early is especially helpful to us as high schoolers. I have heard of Leetcode before but never tried it out before; however, after hearing his advice, I will try my best to pick it up.
- Mr. Mortensen's response: Great write-up.  Excellent how you put your eyes into every situation.  Remind me to add .35 to seed at next review.
