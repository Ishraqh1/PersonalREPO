## 2020 Pracice Exam 1 MCQ Notes
> Questions Googled and Notes on what Researched
- Question 4: Overflow error is when program gets a number, value, or variable that it can't handle
- Question 9: Only one to do with security is public-key, Creative Commons license allows use of some material if creator attributed, high-bandwidth has to do with speed, and redundant routing just makes sure it gets there but doesn't provide security
- Questions 11-12 is about binary and RGB colors, IT GOES FROM HIGHEST TO LOWEST POWER OF 2
- Question 17: Bits can represent all 3 (integer (binary), alphanumeric character (ASCII, Unicode, other character encoding schemes), and machine language instruction (uses binary code))
- Question 35: Generalization of procedure is like procedural abstraction where you organize/encapsulate procedures/algorithms with names and variables or parameters
- Question 40: Certificate authority is a trusted entity that issues SSL certificates, verifying the authenticity of encryption keys for secure  communications
- Question 52: Googled to make sure answer was right, I is correct because of the conditions "REPEAT UNTIL ((hours >= 24) OR (currentPop <= 0)), II is wrong because the change in population isn't displayed per hour and isn't average change, III is wrong because it's not the total population but change in population
- Question 54: CollegeBoard pseudocode reference sheet link: https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-exam-reference-sheet.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles. INSERT (list, i, value) shifts everything with indices greater or equal to i to the right and places value at index i. APPEND (list, value) places value at the end of list.
