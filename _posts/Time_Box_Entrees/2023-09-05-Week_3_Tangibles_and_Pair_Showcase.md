## Plan for Pair Showcase
- Plan is this page! GitHub Issues
- Ask teacher questions: Ask about whether or not os.system (running Linux commands in Python) counts as linux and interaction in VSCode
- Linux: os.system, LIKELY CHANGED
- Python: Python hacks (mean calculator/emoji/wikipedia), Python quiz
- JavaScripts: JS Calculator, JS Tables w/ jquery
- Update Time Box page (see those pages, update as go along)
- Review with ChatGPT: Used to help understand JS Calculator and help add sqrt function + SUMMARIZE CHATGPT RESPONSE INTO PAGE
- Make review ticket (can put it under here on this page)


## Summary and Accomplishments
- (can put stuff did over the weekend, the update blog, python hacks (mean calculator, emoji, wikipedia), JS output tables with jquery, and JS calculator)
