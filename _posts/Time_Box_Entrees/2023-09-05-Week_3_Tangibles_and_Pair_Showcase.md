## Plan for Pair Showcase
- Plan is this page. Check GitHub Issues, should have stuff not done yet (calculator, update time box, linux, chatgpt)
- Ask teacher questions: Ask about whether or not os.system (running Linux commands in Python) counts as linux and interaction in VSCode
- Linux: os.system, LIKELY CHANGE OR UPDATE
- Python: Python hacks (mean calculator/emoji/wikipedia), Python quiz
- JavaScripts: JS Calculator, JS Tables w/ jquery
- Update Time Box page (see those pages, update as go along)
- Review with ChatGPT: Used to help understand JS Calculator and help add sqrt function + SUMMARIZE CHATGPT RESPONSE INTO PAGE
- Make review ticket (can put it under here on this page)

## Review Ticket
> Plan: See above.

> GitHub Issues: Click <a href="https://github.com/JasonGao76/students/issues" target="_blank">here</a> to see GitHub Issues.

> Teacher Interaction: There were numerous interactions with the teachers, but the ones listed are the most relevant and important.
- Towards the beginning, our "make" command worked but the page was not found. After trying to fix the issue and failing, we asked Mr. Mortenson about how to fix it, and we were told to change "0.0.0.0:" to "localhost:", and it worked and allowed our blog to finally run properly.
- Through the blog check, we learned that our Time Box was not done correctly, so we took a look at the examples and other people's code to see what it was supposed to look like. After properly figuring out how to use front matter, we remade our table, updated all the pages, and tested it to make sure it worked.
- We had a plan to incorporate Linux commands into Python and combine multiple hacks into one, but we were not sure if it counted as the separate hacks. During Office Hours, I asked Mr. Mortenson whether or not it would count, and he said it would count because he mainly is trying to see whether or not we understand and can use the parts. Afterwards, we discussed whether or not the plans needed updating and what else we can add onto our hacks.

> Linux and VSCode
- Linux combined with Python_Hacks.

> Python and VSCode
- 

> Web interaction in JavaScript
- 

> All updated in Time Box page: 

> ChatGPT: We asked ChatGPT to help us explain the JavaScript in the JS Calculator. First we asked for a quick summary:
- ChatGPT told us that the code uses HTML, CSS, and JS to make a calculator with GUI and Vanta.js animation. The HTML markup creates a container div (id "animation) to hold calculator and animations, and has a calculator-container div in the container to hold the calculator elements. The CSS defines styles, and the main styles are making the .calculator-output class take up the first row of the calculator, have rounded corners, have a border and padding, and have a font size, and the .row class to have rows. The JS adds functionality by defining firstNumber/operator/nextReady, selects DOM elements using document.getElementById and document.querySelectorAll, has event listeners that detect when these buttons are clicked, and defines functions for numeric, opration, calculate, equal, and clearCalc buttons.

## Summary and Accomplishments
- (can put stuff did over the weekend, the update blog, python hacks (mean calculator, emoji, wikipedia), JS output tables with jquery, and JS calculator)
