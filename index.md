## The Start of a Journey and About Me
My school journey began on August 16th, 2023, and this site's journey began on 19th of the same month! Below is my Freeform picture and a <del>brief</del> explanation of the drawings.
<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1143438030749847604/1143438090745167882/CSP_About_Me_Drawing.png?width=815&height=581">
In the center is a heart around the text "Family & Friends", as I hold them close to my heart since they are the reason why I am who I am today. <br>
Right below the heart is the Chinese flag to show my ethnicity and cultureÔºåËÄå‰∏îÊàëÂèØ‰ª•ËÆ≤‰∏≠Êñá„ÄÇ To the bottom right of the heart is a beaker to symbolize chemistry-- one of my favorite subjects of all time. Above the beaker is a force body diagram of a box with four different forces on them (see if you can guess which ones they are!) to represent physics, one of the funnest classes I have taken at DNHS courtesy of Mr. Liao and Mr. Eckmann. <br>
To the bottom left of the heart is a trumpet, which I have been playing since I was in 5th grade. Above the trumpet is a badminton racket, and I included this because I fondly remember one summer where I played nearly everyday with my sister and it was great fun. <br>
Lastly, above the heart is a book. I love reading (recently I read <i>The Three-Body Problem </i> by Cixin Liu and it was REALLY good, I heavily recommend it to most people) and also love history! <br>
I did not include this because I am a terrible MSPaint artist, but I also love anime (I would recommend Jujutsu Kaisen) and manga and play a good number of anime-style games! I have mainly played Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Honkai Impact 3rd, and Azur Lane. Yes I have sold my soul to Hoyoverse iykyk...

## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
