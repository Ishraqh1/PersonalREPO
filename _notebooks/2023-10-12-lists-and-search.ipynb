It's a lot faster then the iterative approach, where I keep going until I get to 59223 what this does is it allows me to speed up the time and memory usage I take. because I keep dividing the list by 2 allowing for me to form a logarithm because its just repetitive multiplication of 1/2 and then that makes it so that O(log(n)) becomes the time complexity for the Binary search algorithm.\n",
